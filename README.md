# MTZ-Goals-2025
Repository dedicated to the development of my technical skills as the goal of the Metricaz team.


This project aims to create an ATM website focusing on the programming logic for the efficient dispensing of banknotes during withdrawals, always ensuring the minimum possible number of bills. Furthermore, a functionality to add cash to the system will be implemented. The visual presentation (aesthetics) of the website will not be considered for evaluation. Afterwards, it will be necessary to integrate a data layer for tracking clicks, interactions, and callbacks of the interface events.

Considering that aesthetics is not an evaluation factor for this project, a website template available at https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page296/listrace was used. The credits for the template creators are as follows:
