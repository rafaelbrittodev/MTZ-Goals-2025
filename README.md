This project aims to create an ATM website focusing on the programming logic for the efficient dispensing of banknotes during withdrawals, always ensuring the minimum possible number of bills. Furthermore, a functionality to add cash to the system will be implemented. The visual presentation (aesthetics) of the website will not be considered for evaluation. Afterwards, it will be necessary to integrate a data layer for tracking clicks, interactions, and callbacks of the interface events.
